# NASA_ESONET_Climate_Analysis

📌 Project Overview

  Natural disasters such as **wildfires, floods, storms, and volcanic eruptions** cause devastating environmental damage, economic disruption, and loss of human life across the world. Every year, communities face the consequences of these events, from destroyed ecosystems and infrastructure to long-term social and economic impacts.
  
  Climate conditions play a critical role in shaping the **occurrence, intensity, and spread** of natural disasters. Factors like **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation** directly influence how disasters form, evolve, and escalate. For example, low humidity and strong winds can intensify wildfires, while heavy rainfall and wind patterns can drive severe storms and flooding.
  
  This project aims to better understand these relationships by exploring how **local climate conditions** align with **real-world disaster events**. By integrating real-time disaster data from **NASA EONET** with climate observations from the **NASA POWER** API, the project connects where and when disasters occur with the environmental conditions surrounding them. This combined analysis helps uncover patterns that can support improved disaster awareness, risk assessment, and data-driven decision-making.
